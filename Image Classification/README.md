# Image Classification
In this section first of all we classify the dog and cat class based on the dataset in the notebooks . the difference between **cats vs dogs** and **transfer cats vs dogs** notbook is that in the first one we implement a model from scratch with keras but in the second on we use pretrained **Inception V3**.\
In the **MNIST Hu Moments** we classify **MNIST dataset** with **Hu Moments as feature** and use a **SVM** for model.
